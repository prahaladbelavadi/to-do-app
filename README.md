# to-do-app
To Do app design:
Simple and aesthetic mimicking Instagram's KISS policy of eliminating all excessive clutter.
To app would have a login/ register screen which would have options for signing in using gmail, facebook and twitter.
The app would ask you what you are proud of and/or what your failure is
After entering it, there would be a word count and a hashtag added at the end of the statement.
They would then be provided with an option of posting it to their respective social media profiles.

After which their current state of being would be recorded(Happy or sad or disappointed.[similar to company feedback])

Further plans:
Introduction of an anonymous function.
A calendar that shows the dedication and empowers people to work on a regular basis.
A heat map to show a list of achievements and failures together after all both are something to be proud of.
An option to post photos along with it.
An option to record your growth and progress.
A showcase to display your accolades, achievements and stuff you're proud of.
The showcase shall have a failures as well in between with contrasting size to show how failures do not pull you down but rather make you better in the long run.
Providing APIs so that people could import and export content to all of their social media simultaneously and automating various actions that would help keep one motivated on a daily basis.
IFTTT and zapier integration to display push notifications on linked mobile phones to constantly motivate and encourage ourselves.
Anniversaries of achievements and failures displayed.
